Here is this week's list of things I like:

1. [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/)
2. [Flutter](https://flutter.io/)
3. [HelloChinese](http://www.hellochinese.cc/)

### [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/)

[DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/) is a SQL Database playground. It's very useful for collaboration. I like to use it when I want to try different queries out before actually running them on a database.

There's support for several versions of MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.

### [Flutter](https://flutter.io/)

[Flutter](https://flutter.io/) is Google's new (at least it's new for me) SDK for making native apps for Android and iOS. I've never really been a huge fan of React-Native (I usually just go for Ionic if I need to make a quick app) and I find that this new framework makes allot more sense to me. 

I like the prospect of making Native apps like this. It's also backed by Google. I'm hoping Google keeps pushing this framework.

### [HelloChinese](http://www.hellochinese.cc/)

[HelloChinese](http://www.hellochinese.cc/) is an app for learning Chinese. Why am I learing Chinese? I have no immediate plans of moving to China. It's mostly due to research that learning a new language reduces risks of alzheimer's disease and dementia later on ([link here](https://bigthink.com/ideafeed/learning-a-new-language-later-in-life-helps-keep-your-brain-healthy), and [here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5363123/Learning-language-protect-ALZHEIMERS.html)). Brain atrophy is one of those scary things that keep me awake at night. Which is a shame, because sleep deprivation is not good for brain health. At least now, when I lie awake contemplating my own demise. I can distract myself practicing Mandarin! 

Anyways, I found this app to be especially helpful. I wasn't impressed with the Duolingo Mandarin course.
