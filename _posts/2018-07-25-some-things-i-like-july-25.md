Here's a list of three things I like for the week of July 23rd.

1. [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/)
2. [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)
3. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA_g2bQgOXY) from Tech Alter

### [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/)

This, or something similar, very well may be the future of the web. I'm a little late to the game about this, but it seems like an interesting solution to a problem I've been thinking about for a while.

Check it out here:

### [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)

I recently discovered Disqus and was able to use it to add a comments section to my little Jekyll/Github Pages blog. This was surprisingly straightforward and simple to install.


### This Review of KaiOS by [Tech Alter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA_g2bQgOXY)

I found this very interesting. I was totally unaware of that there was a viable third contender in on the mobile operating scene. I at some point was looking into creating apps and installing an open source OS on my phone. I was very bummed out when FirefoxOS died as I thought that was promising.

While I'm not excited about KaiOS being proprietary, I think this new "feature phone plus" market could be fertile grounds for developing/incubating a open source OS for mobile. My reasoning is that the KaiOS feature phone+ market is a new niche that the two giants (iOS and Android) haven't totally cornered yet, so there is room for a FOSS contender to emerge.

I'd be interested to know your thoughts on this? Am I being naive? What haven't I considered?
