I've been working on recently on making an app that tracks your progress through studying the Talmud. I started working on the Gematria part, to generate the numbers of each folio. 

Once I was doing it, I figured I'd make a converter that takes any Hebrew text and returns the numerical value. It was a lot of fun!

Here's an embed from a Codepen pen. You can try putting in your Hebrew name or favorite Hebrew verse and get the numerical value back:
