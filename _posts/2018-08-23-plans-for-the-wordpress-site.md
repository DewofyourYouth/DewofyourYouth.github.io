I have some plans for my WordPress site, I thought it would be cool to try to make a WP theme using [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/) (React) and using only pure CSS (grid, flexbox, floats and stuff, no Bootstrap or Bulma). 

So far I'm finding the most annoying part of using Gutenberg is that when you make a custom block and then change it code - you get this annoying error about make "external changes" and can't edit the block anymore. Has anyone found out a solution for this?

(I've also noticed that someone filed this bug on the Github repo [here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9185).)
