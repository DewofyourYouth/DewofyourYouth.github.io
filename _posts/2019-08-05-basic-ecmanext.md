ES6 has been around for a while and is now supported in all major browsers. I've decided to start writing about what I think are the most important changes in JavaScript.

## Some Background:

 A while back I had read Douglas Crockford's popular and widely influential book, JavaScript: The Good Parts. I really enjoyed it and tried to follow it's advice. (Though, I remember really disliking all those railroad diagrams.) The thing is, it was written in 2008, I recently started to wonder if Douglas Crockford had gone on the record re: what he thinks about ES6.

Come to find out, he's written a new book on JavaScript called ["How JavaScript Works"](https://howjavascriptworks.com/). I haven't yet read his through his new book, but in the opening chapter he writes:

> Compared to a decade ago, I think less of the language is good, but I think that good part is better.

So, suffice it to say, he thinks it's a mixed bag. I'm going to have to read through his book for specifics on what he thinks about it. So I thought it would be interesting to first write down my thoughts and opinions and then compare notes to what I find out reading Crockwell's book.

(I'm in the process of writing this over some time.)

As someone who is far, far less sophisticated than Crockwell, generally speaking, I'm much discriminating about all the new features in JavaScript.

### const and let > var

So hoisting and the global scope were kind of bad in that the produced buggy results, so the new version `const` and  `let` are better. Also, the possibility of of adding braces to set scope was a good thing. Someone once pointed out to me that `const` is somewhat confusing because it's not like freezing an array. I've never suffered from that confusion, so I can simply be empathetic üòè
