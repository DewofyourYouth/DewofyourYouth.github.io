ES6 has been around for a while and is now supported in all major browsers. I've decided to start writing about what I think are the most important changes in JavaScript.

## Some Background:

 A while back I had read Douglas Crockford's popular and widely influential book, JavaScript: The Good Parts. I really enjoyed it and tried to follow it's advice. (Though, I remember really disliking all those railroad diagrams.) The thing is, it was written in 2008, I recently started to wonder if Douglas Crockford had gone on the record re: what he thinks about ES6.

Come to find out, he's written a new book on JavaScript called ["How JavaScript Works"](https://howjavascriptworks.com/). I haven't yet read his through his new book, but in the opening chapter he writes:

> Compared to a decade ago, I think less of the language is good, but I think that good part is better.

So, suffice it to say, he thinks it's a mixed bag. I'm going to have to read through his book for specifics on what he thinks about it. So I thought it would be interesting to first write down my thoughts and opinions and then compare notes to what I find out there.
