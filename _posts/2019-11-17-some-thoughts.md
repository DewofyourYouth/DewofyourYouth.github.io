## Is Vuejs Worth It?

I've been wondering about Vue's future in the frontend framework ecosystem - especially as React seems to take up all the oxegen on the room regarding the integrations with big CMSes - like WordPress - and frameworks like Gatsbyjs and Nextjs gain popularity. The one big space I see Vue making headway is in the Laravel framework. But I'm wondering if most people using Laravel aren't using it as an API and using a full JavaScript frontend anyways (making the advantages of Vue negligible).

I'm saying this as someone who really likes the Vue framework and there emphasis on making the developer experience as intuitive as possible.

## Standardize ORMs

While the value added by ORMs is clear. Could it possibly be time to restandardize the way they query. Are their advantages overshadowed by the chaos they cause by each ORM basically coming up with a newish syntax to do the exact same thing the last ORM did? Sure, add features, but SQL is cool because you can basically move from MySQL to PostGRES to sqlite to whatever with basically no learning curve. Why not keep that advantage?
