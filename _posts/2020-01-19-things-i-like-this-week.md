## [Habitica](https://habitica.com/)

Habitica is an app that helps you gamify your if. This allows you to use the same obsessive focus you commit to getting to the next level in candy crush - with actually attaining life goals, breaking bad habits and enforcing good ones. I've been using it for about three weeks and it has been beneficial to me.

I do have some misgivings about the subtle skinner box like nature of the whole "gamify" idea, but advertisers, media and everything else is leveraging your rat like motivations - so why not let it work for you too?
