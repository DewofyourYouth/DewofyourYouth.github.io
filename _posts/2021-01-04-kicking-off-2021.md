This is the first post of 2021. Here are some plans for the new year.

### Site Makeover

I haven't touched the design of this blog in a long time. I think it is time for a makover.

### More Content

I hope to start writing a new blog post every other week.

### Learn C#, F# and Blazor

I've been avoiding C# and F# because I only user Linux - now that Microsoft has come out with dotnet core 5 - I think maybe it's time to consider jumping on the bandwagon.
I plan to document my progress here on this blog. Also, Blazor's use of WebAssembly seems interesting.
