This is the first post of 2021. Here are some plans for the new year.

### Site Makeover

I haven't touched the design of this blog in a long time. I think it is time for a makover.

### More Content

I hope to start writing a new blog post every other week (I think on Wednesdays).

### Learn C#, F# and Blazor

I've been avoiding C# and F# because I only user Linux - now that Microsoft has come out with dotnet core 5 - I think maybe it's time to consider jumping on the bandwagon.
Also, Blazor's use of WebAssembly seems interesting.

### Master ML

My job has offered to sponsor this. I hope to master the concept of ML including:

- A refresher on linear algebra and other relevant maths
- Take Andrew Ng's Machine learning course and
- Get some chops in TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Maybe get an AWS certification in ML and SageMaker

I plan to document my progress here on this blog.
