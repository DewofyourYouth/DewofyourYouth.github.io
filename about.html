        The name is based on a verse in Psalms 110, Dew of your Youth is the
        blog of Yaakov Shore. According to the midrash (Rabbinic exposition on
        the Bible) this verse is referring to Abraham - who in his youth went
        against the zeitgeist of his times and rejected idolatry and spreading
        monotheism.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've taken this verse as a symbolic homage to iconoclasts and free
        thinkers, who neglect the dogma of their time and follow their own
        beliefs and convictions.

        The hebrew phrase טל ילדתיך is also the numeric value of my Hebrew name
        יעקב אפרים.
